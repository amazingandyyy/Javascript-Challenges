// In this first challenge, you will be following along with this tutorial. You may not understand a lot of these concepts - that's ok! This is meant to introduce you to the process of building a mini application, as well as familiarizing yourself with JSFiddle and how to submit your solutions.

// The code will be provided for you, but don't copy and paste! Follow the steps, write the code, and get excited about making your first app!

// Once you have finished, you will dive into the concepts and really understand what is going on so you can do these things on your own.

// If you get stuck, reach out to us - we are here to help!
