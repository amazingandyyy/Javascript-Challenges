// Use jQuery to display a random message to the user.
// * Start by creating an array of 10 random messages (strings)
// * On page load, the page should have the message "Hello!"
// * Beneath that, add a button that says "New Message"
// * When the button is clicked, randomly select a new message to display on the screen (this will replace the old message)
// * The button should be able to be clicked as many times as you want - every click will change the message
