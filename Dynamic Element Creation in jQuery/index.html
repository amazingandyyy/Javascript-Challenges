<!-- You should keep your DOM manipulations to a minimum. Don't append your elements to the DOM in a loop, as this will results in many DOM manipulations. Instead, add your elements to an array and then append that array all at once.

For an extra challenge, create an input box for the user to select the size of the board. Then print game pieces into their starting location. -->
